Free plugins can be installed by clicking the “Install” button.

Commercial plugins can be installed as a trial by clicking the “Try” button, if Craft is running on a development domain.

## Commercial Plugins

Commercial plugins must follow Craft’s licensing model:

- They are free to try in development environments, but require payment to be used in production environments.
- Commercial licenses are a one-time fee per Craft installation, which comes with access to updates for one year after purchase.
- Additional updates can be available with an annual update fee.

If you have tried a commercial plugin and are ready to buy it, return to the Plugin Store and click on the Cart icon in the header area. You should see your plugin listed in the “Active Trials” section of the Cart modal. Click the “Add to cart” button  to add the plugin to your cart, and then proceed with checkout.

Once you’ve completed the checkout process, your plugin installation will automatically become licensed. You can managed all of your plugin licenses from your [Craft ID](https://id.craftcms.com/) account.
