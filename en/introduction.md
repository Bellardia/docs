About Craft CMS
===============

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It does so by offering developers a high level of flexibility, both in terms of content modeling and the front-end views, while giving content managers a remarkably intuitive authoring experience.

## What it’s For

Craft was made for bespoke websites and mobile applications, where strong control over branding and content types are a priority. It is optimized for creating experiences from scratch, rather than modifying existing themes.

## Tech Specs

Craft is a self-hosted PHP application built on [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/), but you don’t need to know PHP or Yii to use it unless you intend to write your own plugin.
