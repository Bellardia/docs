# Tests

In addition to the template tags that [Twig comes with](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/tests/index.html), Craft provides a few of its own.

## `instance of`

Returns whether an object is an instance of another object or class.

```twig
{% if element is instance of 'craft\\elements\\Entry' %}
    <h1>{{ entry.title }}</h1>
{% endif %}
```

## `missing`

Returns whether a given object is an instance of [MissingComponentInterface](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-base-missingcomponentinterface.html), an interface used to represent components whose types are missing.

```twig
{% if field is missing %}
    <p>ðŸ˜±</p>
{% endif %}
```
